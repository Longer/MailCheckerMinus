= Mail Checker Minus =
The fast way to inbox zero, because that's a thing now.

(This is a fork of Anders Sahlin's "Mail Checker Plus for Google Mailâ„¢")

== Features ==
* Mail preview window, read mail without leaving the current tab
* Delete, archive, spam, star and mark as read functionality
* Desktop and sound notifications when new mail arrives
* Support for multiple Google and Google Apps accounts
* Mailto-links open in your Gmail or Google Apps Mail account
* Monitor all your labels or priority inbox
* Translated to over 60 languages!
* More than 10 different icon sets, choose your favorite!

This claim is currently being verified, but according to the original author:

This extension requires elevated permissions because of the content script that parses mailto-links. It does NOT in ANY WAY monitor private data in your browser!

This extension is in no way affiliated with Google.
